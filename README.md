# LendingClub_Predictive_Analytics

Excited to share my recent project on analyzing and predicting interest rates of loans using the modified LendingClub dataset. In this assignment, I embarked on the journey of exploring and preparing the data for predictive modeling. I leveraged Python and scikit-learn to train and compare different machine learning models, ultimately selecting the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. To fine-tune the SVM model, I performed a grid search to identify the optimal hyperparameters. The results were impressive, demonstrating the power of SVM in predicting interest rates with accuracy and precision. After rigorous testing and evaluation, I confidently deployed the SVM model to predict interest rates for the sample loans in the LC_test_HW2.csv dataset.

The project involved extensive data preprocessing, model training, and comparison. Through this process, I discovered valuable insights and uncovered patterns within the dataset. The SVM model stood out as the most effective in capturing the intricate relationships and nuances within the data. I'm thrilled to present my predictions, along with a detailed report and the Python code (Jupyter notebook), showcasing my approach and methodologies. The clean and well-commented code is not only for the instructor's review but also for my future reference. The .csv File also shows my predictions! Overall, it was an exhilarating project that allowed me to dive deep into the world of predictive modeling, and I'm excited to share my findings with you all on GitHub!
